# DinogameWithSDCC

This project represents the culmination of our learning in the Operating Systems course (CS342302) at Tsing-Hua University, incorporating multiple milestones that guide us through the development of the dinosaur game encountered during Chrome's no-internet error page. Detailed documentation for each phase of the project can be found within the subdirectory files.

**Lecturer**: Prof. Pai H. Chou
**Environment**: Utilization of the Edsim51 simulator on a Linux platform.

## Checkpoints
- **Checkpoint 1**: Establishes a framework for cooperative thread management.
- **Checkpoint 2**: Develops two preemptive threads.
- **Checkpoint 3**: Implements two preemptive threads, facilitated by semaphore usage.
- **Checkpoint 4**: Expands upon Checkpoint 3, increasing the thread count to three.
- **Checkpoint 5 (Part 1)**: Displays text on the lower panel of the EDSIM simulator.
- **Checkpoint 5 (Part 2)**: Finalizes the project with the construction of the dinosaur game.
